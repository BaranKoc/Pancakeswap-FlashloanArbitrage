<h2 align="center">Foreword</h2>

Pancakeswap is the most popular dex on binance smart chain . 
Where there is a market, there are arbitrage opportunities. 
On Pancakeswap we can trade coin A for coin B. You can trade follow a given path e.g. A->B->C->D->A, and if you find correct path at correct time, 
you can get more A than the original input amount! This process is called triangular arbitrage. 

What if we take a large amount of debt, execute a triangular arbitrage with the money we get and pay it back and send our wallet what left after pay the debt.
We could earn lots of monay wihout risking our balance. If you find profitable trading paths using your blockchain development skills, you will only need a
smart contract for execute trade. This project includes needed smart contract for execute this trade.

<h2>What we are going to do for test smartcontracts</h2>

<table class="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Token A</th>
    <th>Token B</th>
    <th>Token C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DAI</td>
    <td>BUSD</td>
    <td>WBNB</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- we will start arbitrage at [DAI/BUSD](https://etherscan.io) pair
-
